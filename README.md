# Synchronize team membership / permissions

This actions reads in a `teams.yaml` file which specifies team
membership and permission. It then synchronizes that with GitHub,
making changes as necessary.

Note that it only touches teams that are specified in the
`teams.yaml`. In other words, if a team is deleted from the YAML file,
the synchronization script won't do anything about it (it has no
knowledge of history).

## Using the action

In the repository that contains your `teams.yaml`, add `.github/workflows/sync-teams.yaml`:

```
name: Teams
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  sync_teams:
    name: Sync
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout teams list
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: main

      - uses: scientific-python/sync-teams-action@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.SYNC_TEAMS_TOKEN }}
```

You will also need to set `SYNC_TEAMS_TOKEN` as a repository secret.
See the [token](#token) section below.

## `teams.yaml` format

```yaml
- name: SPEC Steering Committee
  description:
  members:
    - stefanv
    ...
  permissions:
    - repo: specs
      role: maintain

- name: Community Managers
  description: Scientific Python Community Managers
  members:
    - stefanv
    ...
  permissions:
    - repo: specs
      role: triage
```

[Valid roles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) are:

- `read`: Recommended for non-code contributors who want to view or discuss your project.
- `triage`: Recommended for contributors who need to proactively manage issues, discussions, and pull requests without write access.
- `write`: Recommended for contributors who actively push to your project.
- `maintain`: Recommended for project managers who need to manage the repository without access to sensitive or destructive actions.
- `admin`: Recommended for people who need full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing security or deleting a repository.

## Action output

After the action is run, you will see its output in the _workflow summary_.

## Child teams permissions

Setting repo permissions for child teams is not supported.

## Token

The script requires a classic token with `repo` and `admin:org` permissions, exported as a `GH_TOKEN` environment variable.

A token can be created at:

https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

## Initial creation of `teams.yaml`

Existing team membership can be downloaded from GitHub using:

```
sync-teams-to-gh.py --download > teams.yaml
```

## Revoking team access from repo

Set `role` to None:

```
  permissions:
    - repo: myrepo
      role:
```
